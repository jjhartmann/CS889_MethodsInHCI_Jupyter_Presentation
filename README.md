# Jupyter Presentation

Jupyter is a language agnostic notebook platform that works with a variety of different programming languages in a variety of different ways, including R, Julia, and Python!
This presentation utilizes seaborn/matplotlib and pandas for most of the data mangling, while R is used for the statistical analysis. 
The slidesshow feature of Jupyter along with the plugin RISE is used to create a dynamic presentation that is interleaved with the data analysis to create on-the-fly graphs.
 

## Instalation
1. Install Anaconda package manager https://www.anaconda.com/
2. Create an environment containing both Python3 and R
3. Install all dependencies (note: possible issues between the built in R package manager and Conda may come about, in such a case try defaulting to Conda packages)
4. Install RISE (https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) for interactive presentation capabilities.

## Using R magic cells on a python kernel. 
Inorder to use magic cells, get and install rpy2 (https://rpy2.readthedocs.io)

To activate the R magic in Jupyter, execute these commands in python cell:
```
%matplotlib inline
%load_ext rpy2.ipython
```
